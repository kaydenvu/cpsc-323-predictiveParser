<h1>Predictive Parser Program</h1>
<h2>Given the following CFG and the parsing table, write a program to trace input strings over the alphabet { i, +, - , *, / ), ( } and ending with $.</h2>
To run this program, first input a String in the alphabet { i, +, - , *, / ), ( } **ending with $** <br>
If the String is properly inputted, the program will accept it. Have fun testing different String cases! :)
